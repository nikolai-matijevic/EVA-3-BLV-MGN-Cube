# WIP EVA 3 mount for BLV MGN Cube

![BLV MGN Cube EVA 3 Test_Core Insert CoreXY v1 v5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61649682/178140076-3555508e-bb32-424c-8449-10f2140c63f9.png)

The front and back have been adjusted so the belts can be mounted.

## Issues/Notes

- ~~Belts have to be twisted 180Â° in the back to be attached to the tensioners
- X-Axis endstop requires custom part on the end of the 2020 extrusion to work
- Y-Axis length is reduced because of interference between part cooling fans and belts
- Brobe mount needs to be mirrored
